# C-Sorting-Algorithms
C-Sorting-Algorithms provides essential sorting algorithms implemented in C. This repository includes popular techniques like Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is modular and well-documented, allowing easy integration into projects. The `main.c` file demonstrates their functionality by sorting an array of integers.
